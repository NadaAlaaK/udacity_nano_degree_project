First I cleaned the data by dropping the duplicates, Then answered some questions using visualization techniquesand libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.
  # The first question : 
     what is the most paying companies for data scientist?
   # The second question : 
     what is the states with the max jobs for data scientist?
  # The third question : 
      what is the top 5 industries using data science?
    
Finally it was a simple project but I wanted to practice and have more hands on to gain more skills .
